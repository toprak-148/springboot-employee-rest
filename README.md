# Employee Management API

A simple RESTful API for managing employee records using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA. This project demonstrates the core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with a clean architecture that leverages Controller, Service, and DAO layers.

## Features
- **Employee Management**: Add, update, view, and delete employee records.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Fully functional REST API that returns data in JSON format.
- **Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA**: A lightweight yet powerful combination for quick development.
- **Layered Architecture**: Implements Controller, Service, and DAO layers for a clean and scalable code structure.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name`
2. **Configure Database**: Set up a local MySQL or H2 database and update the application properties accordingly.
3. **Run the Application**: Use `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the application.

## Endpoints
- `GET /employees`: Retrieve all employees

- `PUT /employees/{id}`: Update an existing employee
- `DELETE /employees/{id}`: Delete an employee

## Tech Stack
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **MySQL / H2 Database**

## Future Improvements
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Implement filtering and sorting
- Enhance error handling and validation
